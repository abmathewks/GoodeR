  The GoodeR package contains a variety of functions that streamline common tasks performed by data scientists and
  other analytics professionals who use the R programming language. From data exploration to model evaluation, this 
  package offers a set of functions that will simplify your work and construct baseline models quicker. GoodeR has 
  been developed over the past few years and has enabled me to deliver exceptionally high quality solutions in minimal 
  time. As a result, I can focus more time on the other aspects of projects that are critical for generating a high ROI 
  and high adoption rate.
