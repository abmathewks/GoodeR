  The GoodeR package contains a variety of functions that streamline common tasks performed by data scientists.
  From data exploration to model evaluation, this package offers a set of functions that will simplify your work 
  and construct baseline models quicker. GoodeR has been developed over the past few years and has enabled me to 
  deliver exceptionally high quality solutions in minimal time. As a result, I can focus more time on the other 
  aspects of projects that are critical for generating a high ROI and high adoption rate.
